# Exploratory Analysis with Jupyter Notebook
-----------

One major difference between the software development process you're used to and the process you'll use doing data science is the **scientific process** part of it.

From the onset, we can't know exactly what sort of product we're going to build or how we'll use the algorithms we end up using. The data is a huge source of uncertainty and until we poke and prod it, we'll be painting in the dark.

### Asking relevant questions
The dataset for this project is sales data for a grocery store in Ecuador. We've reduced the dimensionality of the data so it can be quickly analyzed on most people's laptop computers, but there is still be enough data to make meaningful inquiry and make accurate predictions.

As you approach a data problem, you should try to identify your hypotheses and your questions. You should simultaneously try to test your hypotheses and seek answers to your questions; these will likely produce a feedback loop where each new answer kindles in your another question. That's how science works.

At this point, you might not know how many stores you're trying to predict sales for. Do you know how many items the stores sell? What is the date range of the data provided?

### Reading a Jupyter Notebook
This directory contains a [basic exploratory analysis in a Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/twde-datalab/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/Exploratory_Analysis.ipynb). Github can render Jupyter notebooks and by following the link you can read the notebook.

### Working with a Jupyter Notebook
The real fun obviously lies in using the notebook. For this you have to run a Jupyter notebook server locally. If you installed Python 3 using Anaconda, then Jupyter should already be on your path.

1. `cd jupyter_notebooks`
1. `jupyter notebook`

The notebook server should start up and a browser window should open on your machine, allowing you to choose a notebook from this directory.
